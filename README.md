#  Real Estate Price Prediction and Recommender System

This project aims to predict real estate prices and recommend suitable properties based on user preferences. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with an emphasis on explainable AI and robust predictions.

---

##  Project Overview

**The main objectives of this project are:
**
 Predict property prices using advanced machine learning techniques.  
 Provide recommendations based on user inputs (budget, location, features).  
 Analyze and visualize feature importances to understand model decisions.  
 Create a scalable pipeline for future data integration.**



## ðŸ§© Key Features

**Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**

* Handling missing values
* Outlier detection and removal
* Feature scaling and encoding

**Feature Engineering**

* Luxury score and categorization (e.g., `Budget`, `Semi_luxury`, `Luxury`).
* Normalization of feature importance scores from multiple models.
* Aggregation of feature importances:

 **Modeling**

* Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
* Hyperparameter tuning.
* Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²).

**Recommendation System**

* Personalized property recommendations based on user inputs (budget, location, etc.).

 **Explainable AI**

* SHAP values for feature importance interpretation.
* Visualizations of top features influencing predictions.
  
##  Visualizations

* Correlation heatmaps
* Feature importance plots
* Predicted vs. actual price scatter plots
* Interactive recommendation dashboards (optional: Streamlit)


##  Model Evaluation


##  Deployment (Optional)
